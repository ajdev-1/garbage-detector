# Garbage object detection modeling

In this project, I trained an object detection model that classifies garbage into the different German garbage separation categories.
The data basis of this project consisted on the one hand of a data set created for scientific purposes ([Trashnet](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet)) and on the other hand of a small data set that I created and labeled myself.

# Objective
Incorrect waste separation and high rates of misdirected waste have a negative impact on different areas. On the one hand, this harms the environment and, on the other, it leads to increased costs for recycling companies.
<br/><br/>
Accordingly, this project trained an object detection model to help people in private households decide on which way to dispose an object.
<br/><br/>
The development of this app was not part of this project. This project only dealt with the implementation of a first object detection PoC.
For this first PoC I tried to classify objects into the following classes:

- Glass
- Yellow container (German waste system)
- Paper


# Technology


# Results
Due to the too small amount of data, I was not able to train a model that could be used in private households. Nevertheless, this PoC showed that a sufficiently large amount of data definitely offers the possibility for a usable model.
